# NorthHarbor AI

AI-powered retirement planning assistant with personalized projections, Monte Carlo analysis, and report generation.

## How It Works

1. Chat with the assistant to begin a guided intake process.
2. The assistant asks standard retirement planning questions and clarifying follow-ups as needed.
3. Once intake is complete, the system runs financial projections and Monte Carlo simulations.
4. The assistant reviews findings with the client, addresses concerns, and proposes assumption updates.
5. Revised plan versions are generated with side-by-side outcome comparisons.
6. Final retirement plan deliverables are produced in Markdown, PDF, JSON, or Excel format.
7. Structured client documents (such as statements) can be ingested, mapped, and logged for schema evolution.
