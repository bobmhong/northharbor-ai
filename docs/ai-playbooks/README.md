# AI Playbooks

Reusable strategies for AI-assisted development in this project. Each playbook captures a build pattern that worked well so it can be applied to future features.

## What Goes Here

- **Build plans** that organize implementation into parallel workstreams with dependency graphs
- **Prompting patterns** for subagent task decomposition
- **Checkpoint strategies** for catching integration issues between waves
- **Lessons learned** from AI-assisted builds (append to playbooks after completion)

## Naming Convention

Use sequential numbering with descriptive names:

```
001-parallel-build-feature-name.md
002-incremental-migration-strategy.md
```
