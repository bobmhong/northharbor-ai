# Project Conventions

## Documentation Structure

```
docs/
├── overview.md          # Consumer perspective, capabilities
├── architecture.md      # High-level system design
├── roadmap.md           # Current and planned work
├── admin/               # Operational guides
└── design/              # Technical design documents
```

## Design Documents

For significant changes, create a design doc in `docs/design/`:

1. Copy `docs/design/template.md` to `docs/design/NNN-feature-name.md`
2. Use sequential numbering (001, 002, etc.)
3. Fill in all relevant sections
4. Submit as a PR for review

## Commit Messages

Use conventional commits:

```
feat: add Monte Carlo visualization
fix: correct projection calculation
docs: update architecture diagram
refactor: extract simulation logic
test: add interview flow tests
chore: update dependencies
```

## Pull Requests

- Reference related issues: `Closes #123`
- Update documentation when adding features
- Ensure tests pass before requesting review

## Code Changes

- Read files before editing
- Run linters after changes
- Update CHANGELOG.md for user-facing changes
- Add design doc for architectural changes

## Taskfile-First Operations

- Prefer `task <name>` for common developer/operator workflows instead of ad-hoc shell commands
- Use `Taskfile.yml` as the source of truth for routine operations (setup, dev servers, lint, test, health checks, db lifecycle)
- When operational procedures change in docs/runbooks (README, CONTRIBUTING, `docs/admin/`), update `Taskfile.yml` in the same change
- If a repeated operation is not yet in `Taskfile.yml`, add a task before documenting or automating that workflow elsewhere
- Validate task changes with `task --list` and ensure task descriptions are clear and actionable
