# Agent Cleanup Policy

## Test Data

- **Never leave behind test data** created during debugging, development, or verification
- If you create plans, records, files, or any other artifacts to test a change, delete them before finishing
- If you run API calls (e.g. `curl`, `httpie`) that create entities in the running app, delete those entities afterward
- Do not create plans, users, or other domain objects unless the user explicitly asks for them

## Temporary Files

- Remove any temporary or scratch files created during investigation
- If you create a test script to verify behavior, delete it when done (unless the user asked for it)

## Verification

- Before finishing a task, confirm no orphaned test data remains in the running application or on disk
